    <!-- HTML is heirarchial: tags like this define elements on the page. 
    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                I set up an account on the Economics Observatory Data Hub and built two separate charts using the "create" tool. 
                I pasted the json code into Visual Studio Code and saved these files in my GitHub repo. I finally embedded the two charts using the VegaEmbed function.
